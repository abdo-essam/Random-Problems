This code solves a problem that involves calculating the score of two players, Alice and Bob, based on the results of a game that they play.

The game is played between two players A and B, who initially have scores A and B, respectively. The game consists of k rounds. In each round, the scores of A and B are updated according to a rule based on the values of two 3x3 matrices a and b. Specifically, the new score of A is set to be the value of a[A][B], and the new score of B is set to be the value of b[A][B].

After the k rounds are completed, the scores of Alice and Bob are calculated based on the difference between their scores. Alice gets one point if her score is greater than Bob's score, and Bob gets one point if his score is greater than Alice's score. The function calculateScore() is used to determine the winner of each round and update the scores of Alice and Bob accordingly.

The program takes input for k, A, B, a and b, and outputs the scores of Alice and Bob after the k rounds have been played.
