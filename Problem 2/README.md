This code solves a problem related to disjoint sets data structure.

The code starts by declaring an array of vectors called 'edges' which represents the edges of a graph. Each vector in the 'edges' array contains an array of size 3, representing an edge of the graph. The first two elements of the array are the endpoints of the edge, and the third element is an index representing the position of the edge in the input.

The code then reads in the number of nodes and edges in the graph, initializes an array 'parent' of size N to store the parent of each node, and an array 'Rank' of size N to store the size of each set.

The code then reads in the edges of the graph and stores them in the 'edges' array, based on their weights.

The 'findSet()' function uses the path compression optimization technique to find the representative of the set that a given element belongs to. The 'join()' function performs the union of two sets by using the union by rank optimization technique to ensure that the depth of the resulting tree is minimized.

This code does not fully solve the problem as there is no further processing or output after reading the edges and building the 'edges' array. Additional code would be required to use the disjoint sets data structure to solve a specific problem, such as finding the minimum spanning tree of the graph.
